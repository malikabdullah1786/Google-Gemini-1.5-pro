# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running, you'll need to set up your environment variables.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Copy the example environment file to a new file named `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Get your API Key:**

    You'll need a Google Generative AI API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

3.  **Set your API Key:**

    Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:

    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies and run the project:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
